**Priority:** Critical bugs first, then polish and UX improvements

---

## üö® **Critical Issues (Must Fix)**

### **P0 - Blocking Issues**

#### **Issue #1: Recording Functionality Not Working**
- **Problem:** Record button doesn't capture audio events
- **Root Cause:** Recording state not properly connected to event capture system
- **Fix Required:**
  - Verify `LoopManager` is capturing events during recording
  - Ensure `RecordedEvent` objects are being created with correct timestamps
  - Check `AudioStoreConnector` is properly handling recording state changes
  - Validate event capture in `AudioEngine.triggerPad()` during recording
- **Files to Check:**
  - `lib/audio/LoopManager.ts` - event capture logic
  - `lib/audio/AudioEngine.ts` - recording state handling
  - `lib/integration/AudioStoreConnector.ts` - state sync
- **Estimate:** 2 hours
- **Priority:** P0 - CRITICAL

#### **Issue #2: Play All Functionality Not Working**
- **Problem:** "Play All" button doesn't play saved loops
- **Root Cause:** Loop playback system not properly scheduling saved loops
- **Fix Required:**
  - Verify `LoopManager.playAllLoops()` is being called
  - Check loop scheduling in Tone.js Transport
  - Ensure saved loops are properly stored in Zustand state
  - Validate loop event timing and playback
- **Files to Check:**
  - `lib/audio/LoopManager.ts` - playback logic
  - `lib/store/index.ts` - saved loops state
  - `components/ui/FallbackControls.tsx` - button connection
- **Estimate:** 2 hours
- **Priority:** P0 - CRITICAL

#### **Issue #3: Duplicate Control Menus**
- **Problem:** Two menus are layered over each other
- **Root Cause:** Both `VoiceControls` and `FallbackControls` components rendering overlapping UI
- **Fix Required:**
  - Consolidate into single control bar at bottom
  - Remove duplicate UI elements from `VoiceControls`
  - Keep voice status indicator separate from controls
- **Files to Modify:**
  - `components/controls/VoiceControls.tsx` - remove redundant UI
  - `pages/index.tsx` - adjust layout
- **Estimate:** 1 hour
- **Priority:** P0 - CRITICAL

## üîß **High Priority Fixes (Should Fix)**

#### **Issue #4: "Close" Voice Command Not Working**
- **Problem:** Saying "close" doesn't close the instructions overlay
- **Root Cause:** Command mapping issue or state not updating
- **Fix Required:**
  - Verify "close help" command is registered in `vocab.ts`
  - Check `VoiceControls` command handler for "close help"
  - Ensure `onInstructionsToggle(false)` is being called
  - Test with variations: "close", "close help", "hide"
- **Files to Check:**
  - `lib/voice/vocab.ts` - command definitions
  - `components/controls/VoiceControls.tsx` - command handler
- **Estimate:** 30 minutes
- **Priority:** P1

#### **Issue #5: Synth Kit Voice Recognition Fails**
- **Problem:** "Synth" not being recognized by speech API
- **Solution:** Rebrand as "Funk Kit" throughout app
- **Changes Required:**
  - Update kit type from `'synth'` to `'funk'` in types
  - Update voice commands: "funk", "funk kit", "kit funk"
  - Update UI labels and emoji (üéõÔ∏è Funk Kit)
  - Update help section with new commands
  - Update status display
  - Keep file paths as `/kits/synth/` (no need to rename folders)
- **Files to Modify:**
  - `types/index.ts` - update `KitType` type
  - `lib/voice/vocab.ts` - add funk commands
  - `components/ui/InstructionsOverlay.tsx` - update help text
  - `components/ui/StatusDisplay.tsx` - update display
  - `components/ui/FallbackControls.tsx` - update button label
  - `lib/utils/helpers.ts` - add alias mapping for 'funk' ‚Üí 'synth' folder
- **Estimate:** 1.5 hours
- **Priority:** P1

#### **Issue #6: Missing "Stop All" Voice Command**
- **Problem:** No voice command to stop loop playback
- **Fix Required:**
  - Add "stop all" to `vocab.ts`
  - Implement handler in `VoiceControls`
  - Call `useAppStore.getState().setPlaying(false)`
  - Add voice feedback: "All loops stopped"
- **Files to Modify:**
  - `lib/voice/vocab.ts` - add command
  - `components/controls/VoiceControls.tsx` - add handler
- **Estimate:** 20 minutes
- **Priority:** P1

#### **Issue #7: Missing Help Button Fallback**
- **Problem:** No manual button to open instructions if voice fails
- **Fix Required:**
  - Add "‚ùì Help" button to `FallbackControls` component
  - Position near other control buttons
  - Wire up to toggle instructions overlay
- **Files to Modify:**
  - `components/ui/FallbackControls.tsx` - add help button
  - `pages/index.tsx` - pass `onHelpToggle` prop
- **Estimate:** 30 minutes
- **Priority:** P1

---

## ‚ú® **Feature Additions (Nice to Have)**

#### **Issue #8: No Command to Stop Active Sounds**
- **Problem:** Can't stop a currently playing sound triggered by pinch
- **Solution:** Add "stop sound" or "silence" command
- **Implementation:**
  - Create method in `AudioEngine` to stop all currently playing players
  - Add voice command: "silence", "stop sound", "quiet"
  - Add keyboard shortcut (Space bar or Escape)
  - Add fallback button (üîá Silence)
- **Files to Modify:**
  - `lib/audio/AudioEngine.ts` - add `stopAllActiveSounds()` method
  - `lib/voice/vocab.ts` - add silence commands
  - `components/controls/VoiceControls.tsx` - add handler
  - `components/ui/FallbackControls.tsx` - add silence button
- **Estimate:** 1 hour
- **Priority:** P2

## üìù **Notes**

### **Why "Funk Kit" Instead of "Synth"?**
The speech recognition API struggles with "synth" (often hears "since", "cents", etc.). "Funk" is more distinct and easier to recognize. The kit contains Brazilian funk samples, making the name appropriate.

### **Recording System Architecture**
The recording system should work as follows:
1. User clicks "Record" or says "record"
2. `isRecording` state set to `true` in Zustand store
3. `AudioEngine.triggerPad()` checks recording state
4. If recording, creates `RecordedEvent` with timestamp and pad info
5. Event added to `currentLoop` array in store
6. User says "save loop" ‚Üí `currentLoop` moved to `savedLoops` array
7. User says "play all" ‚Üí `LoopManager` schedules all loops with Tone.js Transport

### **Potential Issues to Watch For**
- Tone.js Transport not started before scheduling loops
- Timestamp synchronization (use `Tone.now()` not `Date.now()`)
- Loop length calculation and modulo timing
- Race conditions between state updates and audio engine
