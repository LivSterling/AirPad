## 🔄 **Dependency Chain & Critical Path**

### **Critical Path:**
1. T1.1 (Project Setup) → 
2. T1.4 (MediaPipe) → T1.5 (Grid Mapping) → T1.6 (Audio Triggering) → 
3. T2.3 (Recording) → T2.4 (Loop Stacking) → 
4. T2.12 (Final Testing)

### **Parallel Streams:**
- **Architecture**: T1.3 (Audio Engine) can run parallel with Dev 1 tracking work
- **UI Development**: T1.7-T1.8 can run parallel with core systems
- **QA**: Testing runs continuously alongside development
- **Voice Commands**: T1.8-T1.9 can develop parallel with hand tracking

## ⚡ **Daily Checkpoints**

### **End of Day 1 Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Project builds and runs locally
- [ ] Camera permissions working
- [ ] Basic hand tracking detects pinches
- [ ] Sounds trigger when pinching over grid squares
- [ ] Basic UI grid displays correctly
- [ ] Voice recognition captures "record" and "stop" commands

### **End of Day 2 Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Full recording and loop playback working
- [ ] Loop stacking with "save loop" functional
- [ ] All voice commands working
- [ ] Kit switching operational
- [ ] Instructions overlay toggles correctly
- [ ] Basic error handling and fallbacks in place
- [ ] Works reliably in Chrome desktop

## 🚨 **Risk Mitigation**

### **High Risk Items:**
- **MediaPipe Performance**: Have WebRTC fallback ready
- **Audio Latency**: Prioritize Tone.js optimization early
- **Voice Recognition**: Implement fallback buttons
- **Browser Permissions**: Test permission flows early

### **MVP Scope Protection:**
- If stems system is complex, deprioritize for v1
- Focus on drum kit first, add piano/funk if time permits
- Instructions can be simple text overlay if needed
- Advanced gesture detection can be simplified to basic pinch
