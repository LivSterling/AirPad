# Frontend Dev 1 Day 2 - COMPLETE ✅

**Date:** 2025-10-30  
**Sprint:** Day 2 - Recording, Looping & Kit System  
**Branch:** `dev-1-day-2`  
**Status:** ✅ **ALL TASKS COMPLETE**

---

## Tasks Completed

### ✅ T2.3: Recording Engine (3 hours)

**Objective:** Implement event capture during recording, create master loop length system, build loop scheduling with modulo timing

#### Implementation Details

1. **Event Capture System**
   - Recording now captures all pad triggers with precise timestamps
   - Events stored in `recordedEvents` array during recording session
   - Timestamps calculated relative to recording start time
   - Each event includes: padIndex, timestamp, kitType, velocity

2. **Master Loop Length System**
   - First recording sets the master loop length
   - All subsequent loops synchronize to master length
   - Prevents timing drift in stacked loops
   - Configurable via `setMasterLoopLength()`

3. **Loop Scheduling with Modulo Timing**
   - Loop playback uses Tone.js Transport for precise timing
   - Events repeat using modulo operator: `(timestamp % loopDuration) / 1000`
   - Subsequent takes align perfectly with master loop
   - Supports seamless loop stacking

4. **Recording Methods**
   - `startRecording()` - Clears events, resets master loop, starts capture
   - `stopRecording()` - Returns LoopData with captured events
   - `recordEvent()` - Internal method to capture pad triggers
   - `getRecordedEvents()` - Access current recording events

#### Code Changes
- Enhanced `AudioEngine.ts` with recording infrastructure
- Removed placeholder event handling, now captures real data
- Improved logging for debugging

---

### ✅ T2.4: Loop Stacking System (3 hours)

**Objective:** Create loop layer management, implement "save loop" functionality, build stack playback ("play all"), enable individual control

#### Implementation Details

1. **LoopManager Class (New)**
   - Singleton pattern for centralized loop management
   - Manages multiple concurrent loops
   - Handles synchronization and timing

2. **Loop Layer Management**
   - `playingLoops` Map tracks all active layers
   - Individual loop control via loopId
   - Prevents duplicate playback of same loop
   - Status tracking for each layer

3. **Playback System**
   - `playLoop()` - Play single loop with error handling
   - `playAllLoops()` - Play entire loop stack with stagger
   - `stopLoop()` - Stop specific loop
   - `stopAllLoops()` - Stop all playing layers

4. **Individual Control**
   - Toggle individual loops on/off
   - Query playback status per loop
   - Get all currently playing loops
   - Reset to clean state

5. **EventBus Integration**
   - Emits `loops:started` when loop begins
   - Emits `loops:stopped` when loop ends
   - Emits `playback:allStarted` for stack playback
   - Emits `playback:allStopped` for stop all
   - Error events for debugging

#### Code Changes
- Created `lib/audio/LoopManager.ts` (200+ lines)
- Integrated with AudioEngine
- Proper error handling and logging
- Statistics tracking

### ✅ T2.5: Kit System Implementation (2 hours)

**Objective:** Load and organize 3 kits, implement kit switching, connect to voice commands

#### Implementation Details

1. **Kit Loading & Organization**
   - All 3 kits fully loaded: drums, piano, synth
   - Each kit has 9 samples (27 total samples)
   - Kits organized in `public/kits/` directory
   - Configuration centralized in `getKitConfig()`

2. **Kit Switching Mechanism**
   - `switchKit()` method with error recovery
   - AudioStoreConnector handles kit changes
   - Automatic preload of new kit samples
   - Fallback to previous kit on error

3. **Voice Command Integration**
   - Ready for VoiceController commands
   - Recognizes "set kit drums/piano/synth" commands
   - Emits audio:kitChanged events
   - UI automatically updates on kit change

4. **Features**
   - Kit metadata (name, BPM, key, genre)
   - Dynamic label system for pad names
   - Per-kit sample configuration
   - Master volume/BPM per kit

#### Verification
- ✅ Drums kit: 9 samples loaded
- ✅ Piano kit: 9 samples loaded
- ✅ Synth kit: 9 samples loaded
- ✅ All samples accessible and playable
- ✅ Kit switching works smoothly

## Architecture Improvements

### Recording Flow
```
User Pinches → HandTracker detects → AudioEngine.triggerPad()
    ↓
  If recording: recordEvent() captures event
    ↓
  Events stored in recordedEvents[] with timestamps
    ↓
  stopRecording() returns LoopData with all events
```

### Loop Playback Flow
```
LoopManager.playLoop(loop) → AudioEngine.playLoop(loopId, events)
    ↓
  Tone.Loop created with modulo timing
    ↓
  For each event: schedule pad trigger at (timestamp % loopDuration)
    ↓
  Loop repeats seamlessly with master tempo
```

### Kit System Flow
```
Voice Command "set kit drums" → VoiceController
    ↓
  AudioStoreConnector.handleKitChange('drums')
    ↓
  AudioEngine.switchKit() preloads samples
    ↓
  EventBus emits audio:kitChanged
    ↓
  UI updates pad labels, AudioEngine uses new kit
```

## Known Limitations

1. **Linear Recording**
   - Only records one take at a time
   - Recommended: implement live overdubbing in Sprint 2

2. **Fixed Master Loop Length**
   - Can't change master loop mid-session
   - Mitigatable: reset and start new session

3. **No Loop Editing**
   - Can't edit recorded events
   - Workaround: Re-record the loop

4. **Synchronization**
   - Relies on Tone.js Transport timing
   - Minor drift over extended play (>5 minutes)
   - Acceptable for MVP

## Future Enhancements

### High Priority
1. **Live Overdubbing** - Record multiple takes simultaneously
2. **Loop Trimming** - Edit event endpoints
3. **Tempo Mapping** - Handle variable BPM

### Medium Priority
4. **Loop Markers** - Visual feedback during recording
5. **Advanced Quantization** - Snap to beat
6. **Loop Mixing** - Per-loop volume control

### Low Priority
7. **Stem Separation** - Extract individual tracks
8. **Loop Export** - Save/share loops
9. **MIDI Support** - External device integration
