✓ Kit type compatibility
✓ Visual feedback sync
✓ State management
```

### PadGrid → Pad Components
```typescript
✓ isActive prop (hover state)
✓ isTriggered prop (pinch state)
✓ kitType prop
✓ Visual transitions
```

## Testing Notes

### Manual Testing Procedure
1. Start dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to http://localhost:3000
3. Grant camera permissions when prompted
4. Position hand in camera view
5. Move hand - observe hover highlights
6. Pinch fingers - hear sound trigger
7. Test all 9 pads in grid
8. Verify cooldown (rapid pinches throttle)
9. Test kit switching with voice/buttons
10. Verify visual feedback timing

### Known Limitations
- Grid boundaries may need per-user calibration
- Single hand tracking only (by design)
- Requires decent lighting for hand detection
- Browser compatibility: Chrome/Firefox only
