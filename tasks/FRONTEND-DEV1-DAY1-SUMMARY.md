---

### T1.6: Audio Triggering System (3 hours)  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

- [x] Connect pinch detection to sound playback
- [x] Implement per-pad sound triggering
- [x] Add audio latency optimization
- [x] Visual feedback for hover/trigger states
- [x] Integration with AudioEngine singleton

**Files:**

- `lib/audio/AudioEngine.ts` (optimizations)

---

## 🔧 Additional Work Completed

### Bug Fixes
- [x] Fixed HandTracker TypeScript errors (landmarks validation)
- [x] Fixed VoiceControls kit type mismatch (drums vs drum, synth vs funk)
- [x] Fixed AudioEngine interface for playLoop signature
- [x] Fixed AudioEngine player.loaded property access

### Infrastructure
- [x] Copied audio samples to public/kits/ directory
- [x] Verified all 3 kits (drums, piano, synth) are accessible
- [x] Updated type definitions for proper integration

### Documentation
- [x] Created comprehensive completion report
- [x] Added code comments for future maintainers
- [x] Documented grid mapping algorithm
- [x] Noted calibration points for fine-tuning

- ✅ Proper error handling
- ✅ Singleton patterns for resource management
- ✅ Clean separation of concerns

### Performance
- ✅ Hand tracking optimized (lightweight model)
- ✅ Audio latency minimized (immediate start)
- ✅ Cooldown prevents double-triggers
- ✅ Efficient resource cleanup

---

## 🚀 Ready for Day 2

The following systems are ready for Day 2 integration:

### For T2.3 (Recording Engine)
- ✅ triggerPad() already emits events when recording
- ✅ Timestamp capture ready
- ✅ Event structure defined

### For T2.4 (Loop Stacking)  
- ✅ Loop playback infrastructure in place
- ✅ Event scheduling system ready
- ✅ Transport timing configured

### For T2.5 (Kit System)
- ✅ 3 kits loaded and functional (drums, piano, synth)
- ✅ switchKit() method implemented
- ✅ Voice commands compatible

---

## 🧪 Testing Status

### Automated
- ✅ TypeScript compilation (core files)
- ✅ Linter checks (core files)  
- ✅ Type safety verification

### Manual (Ready for user testing)
- ⏳ Camera permission flow
- ⏳ Hand tracking accuracy
- ⏳ Pinch detection responsiveness
- ⏳ Grid mapping precision
- ⏳ Audio playback latency
- ⏳ Visual feedback

**Note:** Manual testing requires `npm run dev` and camera access

---

## 📝 Technical Notes

### Grid Boundaries (Adjustable)
```typescript
gridLeft: 0.2    // 20% from left
gridRight: 0.8   // 80% from left  
gridTop: 0.15    // 15% from top
gridBottom: 0.75 // 75% from top
```

### Pinch Detection
```typescript
PINCH_THRESHOLD: 0.04    // 3D distance between thumb & index
COOLDOWN_MS: 220         // Minimum time between triggers
```

### Audio Paths
```
public/kits/drums/[9 samples]
public/kits/piano/[9 samples]  
public/kits/synth/[9 samples]
```
