## Current State Assessment

The AirPad MVP project has been initialized with:
- ✅ Next.js 14 + TypeScript project structure
- ✅ Core dependencies installed (Tone.js, MediaPipe, Zustand, Tailwind)
- ✅ Basic folder structure (`/components`, `/lib`, `/pages`, `/types`)
- ✅ AudioEngine implementation with advanced features (limiter, compressor, reverb, delay)
- ✅ Zustand state management with persistence
- ✅ TypeScript configuration with path aliases
- ✅ Sample audio files organized in `/Kits` directory

**Remaining Work:** Architecture refinement, integration patterns, deployment readiness, and ensuring all subsystems are properly connected.

## Implementation Notes

### Task 1.0: Project Setup & Dependencies

**Key Considerations:**
- The project is already initialized with Next.js 14, TypeScript, and core dependencies installed
- Focus on optimization and production readiness rather than initial setup
- Verify MediaPipe CDN configuration works consistently across browsers
- Ensure all sample files in `/Kits` are accessible via the correct paths

**Priority Items:**
- Task 1.7 (constants file) should be completed first as other developers will reference it
- Task 1.8 (error boundaries) is critical for production stability
- Task 1.9 (sample validation) prevents runtime audio failures

### Task 2.0: System Architecture Design

**Key Considerations:**
- Current implementation uses direct singleton access (AudioEngine.getInstance()) which can lead to tight coupling
- The Zustand store exists but is not fully integrated with subsystems
- Voice, hand tracking, and audio systems need coordinated lifecycle management
- Error handling is currently ad-hoc with console.log statements

**Integration Points:**
1. **HandTracker → AudioEngine**: Pinch detection should trigger pad sounds with velocity
2. **VoiceController → Store**: Voice commands should update state, which triggers system actions
3. **Store → AudioEngine**: State changes should control recording, playback, and kit switching
4. **EventBus**: All subsystems should emit events for logging, debugging, and cross-system coordination

**Priority Items:**
- Task 2.2 (EventBus) should be implemented first as other integrations depend on it
- Task 2.4 (error handling) enables consistent error recovery across all systems
- Task 2.10 (vocab.ts fix) is critical - currently maps 'funk' but types expect 'synth'

### Task 3.0: Audio Engine Foundation

**Key Considerations:**
- AudioEngine is well-implemented with advanced features (limiter, compressor, reverb, delay)
- Current sample loading is synchronous which causes long initial load times
- The `/Kits` directory has actual audio files that don't match the helper configuration names
- Loop playback uses Tone.Loop but may have timing precision issues with multiple stacked loops

**Critical Issues to Address:**
1. **Sample Path Mismatch**: `lib/utils/helpers.ts` expects files like `kick.wav`, but actual files are `kick-drum-105.wav`
2. **Kit Type Mismatch**: Code uses 'synth' but vocab.ts has 'funk' intent
3. **Mobile Audio Context**: Requires user interaction to resume; currently not handled gracefully

**Priority Items:**
- Task 3.10 is **CRITICAL** - must map actual sample files to prevent runtime errors
- Task 3.1 (latency optimization) directly impacts user experience
- Task 3.5 (mobile context) is essential for cross-device compatibility

---

## Dependencies & Integration Flow

### Initialization Sequence (Must be enforced)
1. AudioEngine.initialize() - Start audio context, load default kit
2. HandTracker.initialize() - Request camera permissions, start MediaPipe
3. VoiceController.initialize() - Request microphone permissions, start speech recognition
4. EventBus.initialize() - Set up event listeners and cross-system communication
5. Store hydration - Load persisted state from localStorage

### Critical Path for Day 1
```
T1.7 (Constants) → T1.9 (Sample Validation) → T3.10 (Sample Mapping) → T3.1 (Latency Optimization)
                ↓
T2.2 (EventBus) → T2.1 (Store Integration) → T2.4 (Error Handling)
```

### Files That Must Be Created
- `lib/constants.ts` - Application constants
- `lib/events/EventBus.ts` - Event system
- `lib/integration/AudioStoreConnector.ts` - Store integration
- `lib/errors/ErrorHandler.ts` - Error handling
- `lib/monitoring/PerformanceMonitor.ts` - Performance tracking
- `lib/config/FeatureFlags.ts` - Feature flags
- `types/integration.ts` - Integration type definitions
- `.env.local` - Environment configuration
- `docs/architecture.md` - Architecture documentation
- `components/common/ErrorBoundary.tsx` - Error boundary component

---

## Testing & Validation

After completing all tasks, verify:
- [ ] All TypeScript files compile without errors (`npm run type-check`)
- [ ] Application starts without console errors (`npm run dev`)
- [ ] Audio samples load correctly for all three kits (drums, piano, synth)
- [ ] MediaPipe initializes and requests camera permissions
- [ ] Voice recognition initializes and requests microphone permissions
- [ ] EventBus connects all subsystems
- [ ] Error boundaries catch and display errors gracefully
- [ ] Performance monitoring shows acceptable frame rates (>30fps)

---

## Handoff Notes for Other Developers

After completing these architecture tasks:
- **Frontend Dev 1** can begin implementing hand-to-grid mapping and audio triggering (T1.5, T1.6)
- **Frontend Dev 2** can build UI components with confidence that state management is solid (T1.7)
- **QA** can start environment and permission testing (T1.10)

Make sure to communicate:
1. Location and usage of constants file
2. EventBus API and event types
3. Error handling patterns and error codes
4. Performance monitoring integration points
