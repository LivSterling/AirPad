# üî¥ SECURITY NOTICE

## Suspicious Network Activity Detected

### Issue Found
POST request to: `https://secdomcheck.online/alk/g2.php`

### ‚ö†Ô∏è THIS IS NOT FROM OUR CODE

I've searched the entire codebase - **this request is NOT being made by the AirPad application**.

---

## Possible Sources

### 1. **Malicious Browser Extension** (Most Likely)
Check your Chrome/Firefox extensions:
```
Chrome: chrome://extensions/
Firefox: about:addons
```

**Look for suspicious extensions** and disable them one by one:
- Unknown extensions you don't remember installing
- Extensions with poor ratings
- Extensions requesting excessive permissions
- Recently added extensions

### 2. **System Malware**
Run a malware scan:
- Windows Defender (built-in)
- Malwarebytes (recommended)
- AdwCleaner (for adware)

### 3. **Injected Script**
- Check browser DevTools > Network tab
- Look for scripts loaded from unknown domains
- Check Sources tab for injected scripts

---

## What Our App Does (Legitimate)

Our AirPad app ONLY makes these requests:
1. ‚úÖ MediaPipe CDN: `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@mediapipe/hands`
2. ‚úÖ Local audio files: `/kits/drums/*.wav`, `/kits/piano/*.wav`, `/kits/synth/*.wav`
3. ‚úÖ Next.js local server: `http://localhost:3000`

**We do NOT:**
- ‚ùå Make POST requests to external servers
- ‚ùå Send any data to third parties
- ‚ùå Track user behavior
- ‚ùå Connect to analytics services

---

## Immediate Actions

### 1. Check Browser Extensions
```
1. Open chrome://extensions/ or about:addons
2. Look for unfamiliar extensions
3. Disable suspicious ones
4. Restart browser
5. Test app again
```

### 2. Clear Browser Data
```
1. Open browser settings
2. Privacy and Security
3. Clear browsing data
4. Select "Cached images and files"
5. Clear data
```

### 3. Test in Incognito/Private Mode
```
1. Open incognito window (Ctrl+Shift+N)
2. Navigate to http://localhost:3000
3. If error persists in incognito, check system
4. If error gone in incognito, it's a browser extension
```

---

## Network Monitoring

To find the source, open DevTools:

```javascript
// In Console tab, run:
(function() {
  const originalFetch = window.fetch;
  window.fetch = function(...args) {
    console.log('FETCH:', args[0]);
    return originalFetch.apply(this, args);
  };
  
  const originalXHR = window.XMLHttpRequest.prototype.open;
  window.XMLHttpRequest.prototype.open = function(method, url) {
    console.log('XHR:', method, url);
    return originalXHR.apply(this, arguments);
  };
})();
```

Refresh the page and see what logs appear before the suspicious POST.

## Verified Clean Files

I've verified these files are clean (no external POST requests):
- ‚úÖ `pages/index.tsx` - Main app page
- ‚úÖ `lib/audio/AudioEngine.ts` - Audio system
- ‚úÖ `lib/tracking/HandTracker.ts` - Hand tracking
- ‚úÖ `lib/voice/VoiceController.ts` - Voice commands
- ‚úÖ All component files

---

## Current Fix Applied

I've updated the app to require a **"Click to Start" button** before initialization. This:
- ‚úÖ Fixes the AudioContext warning (requires user gesture)
- ‚úÖ Allows you to check network activity BEFORE clicking
- ‚úÖ Gives better control over initialization

---

## Testing Steps

1. **Before clicking "Click to Start":**
   - Open DevTools (F12)
   - Go to Network tab
   - Clear network log
   - Check if suspicious POST already appears
   - If YES ‚Üí It's not from our app (extension/malware)

2. **After clicking "Click to Start":**
   - Monitor network requests
   - Should only see:
     - MediaPipe CDN requests
     - Local audio file requests
     - No external POST requests

---

## Recommended Extensions to Check

Common culprits:
- Coupon/shopping extensions
- Video downloaders
- Cursor/pointer customizers
- Unknown toolbars
- Free VPNs
- Search engine changers

---

## If Issue Persists

1. Test in a different browser (Firefox, Edge)
2. Test on a different computer
3. Run full system malware scan
4. Check browser shortcut properties (malware can modify)
5. Reset browser settings to default

---

## App Status

‚úÖ **AirPad code is clean and secure**  
‚úÖ **Click to Start button now prevents AudioContext warning**  
‚úÖ **No external POST requests in our code**  
‚ùå **Suspicious POST is from external source (browser/system)**

---

**Action Required:** Please check your browser extensions and run a malware scan before proceeding.

Once you've done that, the app should work normally with the new "Click to Start" button!
